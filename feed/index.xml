<p><strong>Raju Gari Dhaba aka Sea Inn&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>A 20 year labor of love, Sea Inn (Raju Gari Dhaba) elevates the Andhra seafood cuisine to new levels. Set near the sea shore, in the shadow of the Rushikonda hill, along the Vizag-Bhimli road. This laid-back mom and pop formation. dishes up a Foodie treat.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="610" height="320" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sea-inn-chai-bisket-food.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-280" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sea-inn-chai-bisket-food.jpg 610w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sea-inn-chai-bisket-food-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></figure>



<p>This place’s name are not particularly imaginative but its setting–not far from the sea shore in the shadow of the Rushikonda hill–certainly is. Started in 1988 by Mr. Venkatapathy Raju, originally from Guntur.</p>



<p>Lakshmi Devi Kakarlapudi, Chef and wife of Venkatapathy Raju – A native of Guntur, Devi learned the art of cooking from her mother. She spent countless hours in the kitchen watching, learning and helping to prepare meals for her family. Since all her recipes are those that have been handed down for generations, Sea Inn is The place for foodies to try traditional home cooked Andhra Non Veg dishes.</p>



<p>The couple have been successfully running Sea Inn for 28 years now, Vizag’s foodies who don’t mind the 15-km drive along the coast to the little restaurant. Must Try: Chicken Biryani and Liver Fry.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>It’s almost too good to be true: a rustic palm-thatched shack, run by a mom-and-pop team</h4>



<p>When the Vizag Municipality wanted to close down the Raju Gari Dhaba for some supposed infraction some years ago, the citizens of Vizag congregated outside the Muni­cipal office to protest, and the decision was quietly reversed. Now that’s what you call ‘by public demand’.</p>



<p>The dhaba is right on the beach, 15 km outside town, hidden off the Bhimli road. It’s almost too good to be true: a rustic palm-thatched shack, run by a mom-and-pop team, Mr and Mrs K.V. Raju (she cooks, he mana­ges) and it specialises in home-cooked Andhra dis­hes, which she learned from her grandmother. The official name is Sea Inn, but everybody simply calls it Raju Gari Dhaba, after the proprietor. It’s set under the palm trees, within range of the ocean spray, and the menu is as minimalistic as the surroundings: just about a dozen dishes for the day, scribbled on a whiteboard. It says that the house specialities are country chicken and mutton keema, but ignore that. The thing to order is their fresh prawns, crab or fish (salt-water or sweet-water), all cooked with a typical Andhra zing. We pondered over the choice of fish—vanjiram or chandua, both fresh from the nearby fish market— and finally settled on a vanjiram curry, fried chandua, and a huge crab in a thick, fiery gravy, with steaming rice. And as we licked our fingers, we understood why the good people of Vizag protested its closure. We’d have protested, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our chef Lakshmi Devi, featured on the Hindu today. This is what Tamanna S. Mehdi said:</p>
<p><a href="http://seainn.raju.com.au/about/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-134 alignright" style="margin-left: 50px;" alt="Lakshmi Devi Kakarlapudi, Chef, Sea Inn" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SeaInn-LakshmiDeviKakarlapudi1.jpg" width="208" height="211" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>For K. Lakshmi Devi, chef at Sea Inn, near GITAM University, Rushikonda, it is solely the love of cooking that drove her along with her husband to start this seafood restaurant twenty years back. Known for her cookery skills in her home kitchen, she decided that a restaurant specialising in serving home-style meals was a great business opportunity. Shy, but ever congenial, Ms. Devi wields her ladle like a wand as she perfectly blends together spices to make her hot curries. She says, “Initially, when we started, our only customers were the nearby college students; but as word spread, clientele increased, and we won prestigious food awards. Now, this acts as a stimulant and motivates us more.”K. Srikanth, manager with Bosch, says, “I studied at GITAM and we always had lunch at Sea Inn. We never felt the need to get food from home as the food here tastes exactly like home-cooked.” Smiling sweetly and wiping the sweat off her forehead with her sari pallu, she concludes, “Even though my children are well-settled now, cooking lunch here has become a happy routine that I am not ready to stop.” For a special dish to order call: 9866806353.</p></blockquote>

<p>ON the Rishikonda Beach Road about 15 kilometres outside Visakhapatnam, stands a quaint thatched cottage with a Castrol-sponsored signboard that says “Sea Inn”. It is a small little restaurant specialising in coastal Andhra food.</p>
<p>The proprietor, maitre d’hotel, and waiter is a tall, athletic and good-looking man by the name of K. V. Raju. And the cook, working hard in a small and stuffy kitchen behind, is his comely wife Lakshmi Devi.</p>

Started in 1988 by Mr. Venkatapathy Raju, originally from Guntur, this restaurant is as low-key as its soft-spoken owner.</p>
<p>Even though an element of reverse-snobbery is probably responsible for its growing popularity, Sea Inn is not without its intrinsic charms, chief among these being the fact that it does not pretend to be anything more than what it is&#8211;a large hut in which a limited variety of local dishes, tastily but un-fussily prepared and served in an extremely modest setting to a clientele ranging from (on the day we went) retired naval officers and a local MLA to a Punjabi NRI (whose enjoyment of the food did not appear to be affected by the fact that it was unlikely that she had ever been served this kind of food in a regular dhaba) and a large well-to-do family from Calcutta.</p>
