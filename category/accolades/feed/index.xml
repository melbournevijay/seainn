										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our chef Lakshmi Devi, featured on the Hindu today. This is what Tamanna S. Mehdi said:</p>
<p><a href="http://seainn.raju.com.au/about/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-134 alignright" style="margin-left: 50px;" alt="Lakshmi Devi Kakarlapudi, Chef, Sea Inn" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SeaInn-LakshmiDeviKakarlapudi1.jpg" width="208" height="211" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>For K. Lakshmi Devi, chef at Sea Inn, near GITAM University, Rushikonda, it is solely the love of cooking that drove her along with her husband to start this seafood restaurant twenty years back. Known for her cookery skills in her home kitchen, she decided that a restaurant specialising in serving home-style meals was a great business opportunity. Shy, but ever congenial, Ms. Devi wields her ladle like a wand as she perfectly blends together spices to make her hot curries. She says, “Initially, when we started, our only customers were the nearby college students; but as word spread, clientele increased, and we won prestigious food awards. Now, this acts as a stimulant and motivates us more.”K. Srikanth, manager with Bosch, says, “I studied at GITAM and we always had lunch at Sea Inn. We never felt the need to get food from home as the food here tastes exactly like home-cooked.” Smiling sweetly and wiping the sweat off her forehead with her sari pallu, she concludes, “Even though my children are well-settled now, cooking lunch here has become a happy routine that I am not ready to stop.” For a special dish to order call: 9866806353.</p></blockquote>

<p>ON the Rishikonda Beach Road about 15 kilometres outside Visakhapatnam, stands a quaint thatched cottage with a Castrol-sponsored signboard that says “Sea Inn”. It is a small little restaurant specialising in coastal Andhra food.</p>
<p>The proprietor, maitre d’hotel, and waiter is a tall, athletic and good-looking man by the name of K. V. Raju. And the cook, working hard in a small and stuffy kitchen behind, is his comely wife Lakshmi Devi.</p>
